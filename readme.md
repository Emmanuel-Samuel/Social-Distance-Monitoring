## General Information
A project based on detecting social distance and alerting warnings using background
subtraction. This system uses computer vision techniques like background substraction,
object detection, and tracking to monitor the distance between people in a video feed.
When the system detects that the distance between two people is too close, it alerts the
user with a warning message or sound. This is useful in pandemic situations.
